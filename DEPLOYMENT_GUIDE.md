# GitHub Pages Deployment Setup - Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What I've Done

I've successfully configured your Nuxt website for GitHub Pages deployment. Here's what was set up:

### 1. **Nuxt Configuration** (`nuxt.config.ts`)
- ✅ Configured `baseURL` to `/octopus/` for production (GitHub Pages subdirectory)
- ✅ Enabled static site generation with `ssr: false`
- ✅ Set up proper asset directory structure

### 2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- ✅ Created automated deployment workflow
- ✅ Triggers on every push to `main` branch
- ✅ Also supports manual deployment via GitHub UI

### 3. **GitHub Pages Configuration**
- ✅ Added `.nojekyll` file to prevent Jekyll processing
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript configuration by adding `@types/node`

### 4. **Documentation**
- ✅ Updated `README.md` with deployment instructions
- ✅ All changes committed and pushed to GitHub

## 🚀 Next Steps - Complete the Setup

You need to configure GitHub Pages to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch. Here's how:

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Pages Source
1. Go to: **https://github.com/adawatia/octopus/settings/pages**
2. Under **"Source"**, select **"Deploy from a branch"** from the dropdown
3. Under **"Branch"**, select:
   - Branch: **gh-pages**
   - Folder: **/ (root)**
4. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment
- The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically start building and deploying your site
- You can monitor the progress:
  1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
  2. You should see a workflow run called "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
  3. Click on it to see the build progress
  4. Wait for the job to complete (usually takes 2-3 minutes)
  5. Once complete, the `gh-pages` branch will be created with your built files

### Step 3: Access Your Site
Once deployment is complete, your site will be live at:

**🌐 https://adawatia.github.io/octopus/**

## 📝 Important Notes

### Automatic Deployments
- Every time you push to the `main` branch, your site will automatically rebuild and redeploy
- No manual intervention needed after the initial setup

### Manual Deployment
If you ever need to manually trigger a deployment:
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** → **Run workflow**

### Local Development
- Your local dev server (`npm run dev`) still works at `http://localhost:3000`
- The `/octopus/` base path only applies to production builds

### Testing Production Build Locally
To test the production build locally before deploying:
```bash
npm run generate
npx serve .output/public
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### What the Workflow Does
1. **Checkout**: Gets your code from the `main` branch
2. **Setup Node**: Installs Node.js v20
3. **Install Dependencies**: Runs `npm ci` for clean install
4. **Generate**: Builds static site with `npm run generate`
5. **Deploy to gh-pages**: Pushes the `.output/public` directory to the `gh-pages` branch
6. **GitHub Pages**: Automatically serves the site from the `gh-pages` branch

### Branch Structure
- **`main` branch**: Your source code (Vue components, configs, etc.)
- **`gh-pages` branch**: Built static files (HTML, CSS, JS) - auto-generated by the workflow

### File Structure
```
.github/
  workflows/
    deploy.yml          # Automated deployment workflow

public/
  .nojekyll            # Prevents Jekyll processing

nuxt.config.ts         # Configured for GitHub Pages
```

## ✨ You're All Set!

Just complete Step 1 above (enable GitHub Pages in settings), and your site will be live in a few minutes!
